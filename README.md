## Origin
A couple of months ago, a friend of mine wanted to add [Trash It](https://github.com/Draylar/trash-it) to our friends-only 1.16.4 modpack. After giving it a test, I discovered that *Trash It* was effectively locked to 1.16.1 because the GUI library used ([Spinnery](https://github.com/vini2003/Spinnery)) would call a method which did not exist on newer versions and cause the game to crash. Bumping to the latest version for *Spinnery* did not solve the issue, and no other updates were available as *Spinnery* had been abandoned.

Since my buddy was adamant that a trash can mod be included the pack, I decided to repurpose the model from *Trash It* and quickly write up a new 1.16.4 project which utilizes an actively developed GUI library (ended up being [LibGui](https://github.com/CottonMC/LibGui)). 

I've recently decided to publicize this project, so I've cleaned things up a bit and updated it to 1.16.5.
